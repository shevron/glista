Installation Instructions
-------------------------
Glista can be installed from source on most GNU/Linux systems easily, by
running the following commands in the source base directory:

$ ./configure
$ make

And then switching to 'root' (through 'su' or 'sudo') and running:
# make install

Glista could then be started by running 'glista'.

It is recommended to add glista to your desktop startup programs. For example
in GNOME this is done through 'Sessions' in the System -> Preferences menu.

System Requirements
-------------------
Glista has been tested and is known to run well on several GNU/Linux 
distributions, on i386 and x86-64 platforms, but will probably run well on
other UNIX-like systems.

In order to build glista as described above you will need the following 
libraries installed:
- glibc    >= 2.3
- glib     >= 2.6
- gtk+     >= 2.12
- libxml   >= 2.6

Optionally, Glista may use the following libraries if they are available:
- libunique   >= 1.0
- liggtkspell

You will also need some build tools such as GNU gcc and gtk-builder-convert.
