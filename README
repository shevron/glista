Overview
--------
Glista aims to be a very simple personal to-do list manager that does what 
it's supposed to, and does not get in your way.

The main focus of Glista is on staying a very simple tool. We believe task 
tracking is a trivial part of our daily work (or life) and that it should 
stay trivial.

Technically, Glista is written in C and is based on the Gtk+ grapical 
toolkit and Glib, making it potentially cross-desktop and cross-platform. 
Currently it is known to runs on different flavours of GNU/Linux, but should
be easily portable to other UNIX-like systems, and also to Mac OS X and 
Microsoft Windows.
